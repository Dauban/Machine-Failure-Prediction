# Machine-Failure-Prediction
A machine learning project for predicting machine failures using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes. Includes feature engineering, data preprocessing, model evaluation (precision, recall, accuracy), and hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV. Implements feature selection to optimize model performance.
